## What is Typst?

Typst is a modern markup-based typesetting system designed as an alternative to LaTeX. It offers:

- Faster compilation times
- A more intuitive syntax
- First-class programming constructs

- The ability to watch files and instantly preview changes

Typst combines the power of a markup language with the convenience of a WYSIWYG editor, making document creation more efficient and less frustrating than traditional typesetting systems.
